## Project Overview

This project is part of the **ALX Frontend Engineering Programme**. 
The goal was to convert a high-fidelity [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/dyYL6Ku4WG7vsdpwvlcJZC/Homepage?node-id=0-1&p=f) into a fully styled, pixel-perfect webpage using **HTML5** and **advanced CSS techniques** — without any frameworks.

Starting from the `index.html` of the previous HTML Advanced project, we built a complete, responsive landing page with custom styling.
